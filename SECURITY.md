# Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Gbawo Finance Core Service.

## üõ°Ô∏è Implemented Security Features

### 1. Security Headers (Helmet)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks and code injection
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information sent to other sites
- **Hide X-Powered-By**: Removes Express.js fingerprinting

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Enhanced Validation Pipeline**: Custom validation with security threat detection
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic removal of malicious scripts and code
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Pattern detection and blocking
- **XSS Protection**: Script tag and JavaScript protocol removal
- **Prototype Pollution Prevention**: Dangerous object keys detection
- **Request Size Limits**: 10MB default limit to prevent DoS attacks

### 3. CORS Configuration (Environment-Based)
- **Environment-Driven Origins**: CORS allowed origins configured via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- **Default Internal Origins**: Falls back to localhost/127.0.0.1 on common ports if not configured
- **Dynamic Origin Checking**: Logs and blocks unauthorized origins with detailed information
- **Credentials Support**: Properly configured for internal service communication
- **Method Restrictions**: Only allows necessary HTTP methods

### 4. Security Monitoring & Logging
- **Comprehensive Security Event Logging**: All security events are logged with severity levels
- **Attack Pattern Detection**: Identifies potential SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal attempts
- **Request Monitoring**: Tracks all incoming requests with security metadata
- **IP-based Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring for external IPs
- **Security Event History**: In-memory storage of recent security events

### 5. Error Handling & Information Disclosure Prevention
- **Sanitized Error Responses**: Removes sensitive information from error messages
- **Attack Detection via Errors**: Identifies security attacks through error patterns
- **Development vs Production**: Different error detail levels
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Automatic removal of passwords, tokens, and keys

### 6. Request Processing Security
- **Header Validation**: Checks for suspicious user agents and injection patterns
- **Path Validation**: Detects path traversal and suspicious path access
- **Request Pattern Analysis**: Identifies potentially malicious request patterns

### 7. Content Compression & Performance
- **Gzip Compression**: Reduces bandwidth usage and improves performance
- **Security-aware Compression**: Maintains security while optimizing performance

## üìä Security Endpoints

### Security Monitoring Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/security/events` - View recent security events
- `GET /api/v1/security/events/by-type` - Filter events by type
- `GET /api/v1/security/health` - Security system health check

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```env
# Database Configuration (Required)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=gbawo_finance
DB_DIALECT=postgres

# Application Configuration (Required)
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Security Configuration (Optional)
# Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins
# If not provided, defaults to localhost and 127.0.0.1 on ports 3000, 3001, 8080
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:8080,http://your-internal-service.local

# Maximum request size in bytes (default: 10MB = 10485760 bytes)
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=10485760

# Maximum number of security events to keep in memory (default: 1000)
MAX_SECURITY_EVENTS=1000

# Rate Limiting (for future use)
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
```

### Security Configuration Service
The application includes a centralized `SecurityConfigService` that manages:
- **Helmet configuration**: CSP, security headers, and protection settings
- **CORS settings**: Environment-based origin configuration with fallback defaults
- **Validation rules**: Request size limits, sanitization settings, and strict validation modes
- **Monitoring preferences**: Log levels, event storage limits, and security header controls
- **Rate limiting settings**: Window duration and request limits (ready for future implementation)

## üîç Security Event Types

The system logs various security events:

### Critical Events
- `MALICIOUS_INPUT_DETECTED` - Dangerous patterns in input data
- `PROTOTYPE_POLLUTION_ATTEMPT` - Attempt to pollute object prototypes
- `SQL_INJECTION_ATTEMPT` - Potential SQL injection attack
- `POTENTIAL_SQL_INJECTION` - SQL-related errors that might indicate attacks
- `SERVICE_STARTED` - Service startup with security configuration

### High Priority Events
- `SECURITY_THREAT_DETECTED` - General security threats in headers
- `SUSPICIOUS_PATH_ACCESS` - Access to suspicious file paths
- `HEADER_VALIDATION_FAILED` - Malicious headers detected
- `PATH_TRAVERSAL_ATTEMPT` - Directory traversal attempts
- `POTENTIAL_XSS_ATTEMPT` - Cross-site scripting attempts

### Medium Priority Events
- `CORS_VIOLATION` - Blocked CORS requests
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` - Input validation failures
- `OVERSIZED_REQUEST` - Requests exceeding size limits
- `EXTERNAL_IP_ACCESS` - Access from external IP addresses
- `REQUEST_FAILED` - Failed requests with error details
- `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` - Auth-related failures

### Low Priority Events
- `REQUEST_RECEIVED` - All incoming requests
- `REQUEST_COMPLETED` - Successfully processed requests

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Security Components
1. **SecurityService**: Core security functionality and event logging
2. **SecurityInterceptor**: Request/response security validation
3. **SecurityValidationPipe**: Enhanced input validation with threat detection
4. **SecurityExceptionFilter**: Secure error handling with attack detection
5. **SecurityController**: Security monitoring endpoints
6. **SecurityConfigService**: Centralized security configuration

### Security Flow
1. Request arrives ‚Üí Helmet security headers applied
2. CORS validation ‚Üí SecurityInterceptor validation
3. Input validation ‚Üí SecurityValidationPipe processing
4. Business logic execution
5. Response ‚Üí SecurityExceptionFilter (if errors)
6. Security event logging throughout the process

## üéØ Internal Service Optimizations

Since this is an internal service, the security configuration includes:

- **No HTTPS Enforcement**: Suitable for internal network communication
- **Higher Rate Limits**: More permissive for internal service-to-service calls
- **Internal IP Recognition**: Different monitoring levels for internal vs external IPs
- **Development-friendly CSP**: Allows inline styles/scripts for Swagger UI
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed security event logging for monitoring

## üöÄ Getting Started

The security measures are automatically enabled when you start the application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Monitor security events at:
- Health Check: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/security/health`
- Recent Events: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/security/events`
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

## üìà Monitoring

Security events are logged to the console with appropriate severity levels:
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required
- **High**: Security concern that should be investigated
- **Medium**: Potential security issue
- **Low**: Normal operational security events

All events include timestamps, IP addresses, request details, and relevant metadata for security analysis.

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

The security foundation is in place for future enhancements:
- Rate limiting implementation (infrastructure ready)
- External SIEM integration
- Advanced threat detection
- Security metrics and dashboards
- Automated response systems
